# Understanding Azure Basics

Azure is a cloud computing platform provided by Microsoft, offering a wide range of services for building, deploying, and managing applications and services through Microsoft-managed data centers.

## What is Azure?

Azure provides a variety of cloud services, including computing power, storage, and networking, enabling businesses to build, deploy, and manage applications and services without the need to invest in physical infrastructure.

## Azure Regions and Availability Zones

- **Azure Regions**: Geographical areas containing data centers where Azure resources are hosted. Each region is independent and consists of one or more data centers.
